# Project Overview

In this project, we'll predict the future price of Bitcoin.  We'll use historical data on the price of Bitcoin, along with data from Wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page.  We'll merge and combine this data, then use it to train a random forest model that will tell us if Bitcoin prices will increase or decrease tomorrow.  We'll then switch to an XGBoost model and better predictors to improve accuracy.

We'll develop a backtesting system and use a robust error metric so we can tell if the algorithm is performing well.

This project can be extended to other cryptocurrencies as well.

**Project Steps**

* Load in data
* Clean and merge data
* Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy
* Switch to a more powerful model and improve our predictors
